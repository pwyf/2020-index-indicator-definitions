# Technical Consultation for the 2020 Aid Transparency Index (closed)

## Go straight to the [Indicators to view the discussion &raquo;](https://github.com/pwyf/latest-index-indicator-definitions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

This consultation ran until **19 September 2019**. We will confirm the final tests that will be used in the next Aid Transparency Index shortly.

Please note that this consultation was only on data quality tests used for IATI XML data and not on the Index indicators or the overall methodology. All indicators used in the Aid Transparency Index will be retained.

Please also note that we will no longer be reviewing data published in IATI version 1.0x since this version has now been [deprecated by IATI](https://iatistandard.org/en/news/notice-deprecation-of-version-1-of-the-iati-standard/).
