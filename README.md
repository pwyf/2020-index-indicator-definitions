# Technical Consultation for the 2020 Aid Transparency Index

## Go straight to the [Indicators to add your comments &raquo;](https://github.com/pwyf/latest-index-indicator-definitions/issues)

We welcome feedback on the data quality tests run against IATI XML data as part of the Aid Transparency Index.

This consultation runs until **19 September 2019**. We will confirm the final tests that will be used in the next Aid Transparency Index shortly thereafter.

If you have any comments on the tests for each indicator, please add them under the relevant [issue](https://github.com/pwyf/latest-index-indicator-definitions/issues).

Please note that this consultation is only on data quality tests used for IATI XML data and not on the Index indicators or the overall methodology. All indicators used in the Aid Transparency Index will be retained.
